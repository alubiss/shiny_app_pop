## 1. Introduction

A project prepared as part of the course ["Advanced Programming in R"](https://usosweb.wne.uw.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&prz_kod=2400-DS1APR).

The data used for visualization are from the **spData** package.

## 2. Project goals

### **The goals of assessment:**

*- preparing a web application,*

*- advanced data processing with dplyr, dtplyr, tidyr,*

*- creating advanced functions,*

*- using R Markdown.*

## 3. Description of the application

Based on the dataset, an application has been prepared that shows the distribution of life expectancy, GDP 
and population in the world. The application consists of four subpages, where we can choose the parameters 
for which we want to display the data and the title page which contains a description of the application. 
Additionally, from each subpage we can generate a report which is prepared in R Markdown. 
The dataset is edited using tidyverse and dplyr library. The set of functions used in the project is in a 
separate file.
